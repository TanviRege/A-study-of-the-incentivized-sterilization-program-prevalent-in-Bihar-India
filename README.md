# A-study-of-the-incentivized-sterilization-program-prevalent-in-Bihar-India
//Utilized STATA-16 to analyze data from Indiaâ€™s National Family Health Survey to identify the most popular contraception method and tested the effectiveness of incentivized sterilization with a probit regression model.
//Phase I - Identifying the contraception method that was the most popular one in Bihar (1992
- 2019) and examining whether it is the most effective one
